\begin_layout Standard
In an attempt to reduce the dimensionality of our regression features, we
 selected the two most significant features: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 percentage change in price-open
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 percentage change in volume-open
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While logistic regression is able to fit a model with the two-dimensional
 feature set, the result is quite poor.
 The average profit made via trading on the selected 25 stocks is -? with
 a x% precision and y% recall.
 Then we tested our logistic regression model on the training set (9:30am
 to 11:00am) again and the results are also quite poor (give stats), this
 suggests that our model is suffering from high variance, and we must choose
 more descriptive features while keeping low dimensionality.
 Specifically, the percentage changes in price and volume of the one-minute
 timeframes are extremely volatile quantities, they are influenced by general
 trends of the market which normally lasts longer than one minute.
 For example, if the market enters a mode of frequent fluctuations in a
 certain time, then large 1-minute percentage changes in price or volume
 becom less significant in comparison to the general trend.
 On the other hand, in a smoother market, even small percentage changes
 need to be considered with higher weights.

As a result, we decide to model the local general trend of the market from
 the high-low spread of the previous 5 minutes of any given time.
 Instead of using one-minute percentage changes, we choose to use percentage
 change
